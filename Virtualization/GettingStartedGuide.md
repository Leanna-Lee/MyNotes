## What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is a broad computing term used for running software, usually multiple operating systems, concurrently and in isolation from other programs on a single system.  
Virtualization is accomplished by using a hypervisor. This is a software layer or subsystem that controls hardware and enables running multiple operating systems, called virtual machines (VMs) or guests, on a single (usually physical) machine. This machine with its operating system is called a host.

There are several virtualization methods:  
#### Full virtualization
#### Paravirtualization
#### Software virtualization (or emulation)
#### Containerization
